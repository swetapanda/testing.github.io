Hello,

I am Sweta, a senior member of technical staff at the [Machine Learning Research Group, Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:49:::::P49_PROJECT_ID:7)  
Previously, I was a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, fortunate to be advised by Professor Yevgeniy Vorobeychik. My broad research interests include on computational game theory, large-scale stochastic planning problems: markov decision processes (MDPs), machine learning, optimization, reinforcement learning, multiagent systems and artificial intelligence.

Previously, I graduated with BTech in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.  

For more information, please see my  [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sfvmslymrgmpudt/CV_Sweta_Panda.pdf?dl=0)  and  list of publications. You can also reach me via [swetasudha.panda at vanderbilt dot edu].

For me, the painful aspects of making a website are

- Working with html and css
- Finding a hosting site
- Transferring stuff to the hosting site

With [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), you just write things in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
[GitHub](https://github.com) hosts the site for you, and you just push
material to your GitHub repository with `git add`, `git commit`, and
`git push`.

If you love [git](https://git-scm.com/) and
[GitHub](https://github.com), you'll love
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), too.

The sites use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a
[ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) [gem](https://rubygems.org/), to
convert Markdown files to html, and this part is done
automatically when you push the materials to the `gh-pages` branch
of a GitHub repository.

The [GitHub](https://pages.github.com) and
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) documentation is great, but I thought it
would be useful to have a minimal tutorial, for those who just want to
get going immediately with a simple site. To some readers, what GitHub
has might be simpler and more direct.  But if you just want to create
a site like the one you're looking at now, read on.

Start by reading the [Overview page](pages/overview.html), which
explains the basic structure of these sites. Then read
[how to make an independent website](pages/independent_site.html). Then
read any of the other things, such as
[how to test your site locally](pages/local_test.html).

- [Overview](pages/overview.html)
- [Making an independent website](pages/independent_site.html)
- [Making a personal site](pages/user_site.html)
- [Making a site for a project](pages/project_site.html)
- [Making a jekyll-free site](pages/nojekyll.html)
- [Testing your site locally](pages/local_test.html)
- [Resources](pages/resources.html)

If anything here is confusing (or _wrong_!), or if I've missed
important details, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site/issues), or (even
better) fork [the GitHub repository for this website](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site),
make modifications, and submit a pull request.
