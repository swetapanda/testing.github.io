Hello, 

I am Sweta, a senior member of technical staff at the </font>  [<font color="DarkRed"> Machine Learning Research Group, Oracle Labs </font>](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:49:::::P49_PROJECT_ID:7).  Previously, I was a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, fortunate to be advised by Professor Yevgeniy Vorobeychik. I graduated with BTech in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.  

My broad research interests include on computational game theory, large-scale stochastic planning problems: markov decision processes (MDPs), machine learning, optimization, reinforcement learning, multiagent systems and artificial intelligence. My current research is on algorithmic fairness. 

For more information, please see my  [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sfvmslymrgmpudt/CV_Sweta_Panda.pdf?dl=0)  and following is a list of my publications.  You can also reach me via [swetasudha.panda at oracle dot com].
